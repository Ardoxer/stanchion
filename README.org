* Stanchion
/Keeping requests in line./

** Overview
Stanchion is an application to enforce the serialization of
requests. It consists of two main parts: a simple HTTP interface and a
=gen_server= process that interacts with a local Riak instance to
manage requests. The HTTP interface is intended to remain constant
while the =gen_server= is intended to be replace with a more robust
and efficient means of handling the serialization.
